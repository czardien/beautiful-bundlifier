# beautiful-notifications-bundler

This repository hosts codebase and instrumentation for an application to push notifications given an event stream.

## Features

**TODO**

## Limitations

The main limitation we find about this challenge is that we're essentially asked to make informed decisions based on future data. e.g. send a notification at 10am to a given user on a given day given the total number of notifications that day.

If not we're essentially asked to mock a producer / consumer of messages for which I cannot see an easy way to do.
